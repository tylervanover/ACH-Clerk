ACH-Clerk
=========

A program that will help an employee select the most appropriate documents for a customer to 
assist them in migrating their existing ACH transactions to a new account.

What I intend to do is simple:

1. Create a GUI for the employee to filter numerous ACH Account Change forms by
a search bar, say if they didn't know the name of the company, but new that it was a utility service. 
That, or if the customer does know the name of the billing company, we can select
their specific ACH Account Change form.

2. Allow the employee to merge all the ACH Account Change forms into a single .PDF.

3. Print the .PDF packet for the customer to take and switch.

4. IF no ACH Account Form exists for that company, or if we do not have it on file,
we'll be able to search the web and pull phone numbers / URL's into a table for
the customer to have. (future release)
