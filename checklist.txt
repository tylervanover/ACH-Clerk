[DONE]1. Build a "remove selected packet" and "remove all selected" function.
2. Render the native doc to the PreviewPaneForm (it should be resizable, scrollable, etc.).
3. Fix the PreviewPaneForm_Load function so that it loads natively docked to the right side of the parent form.
[FUTURE]4. Tables?
[DONE]5. Search functionality to filter through tags. Remember, this should be for HUNDREDs of forms, not 8.
6. Need to put in menu tools for eliminating clunky buttons, but still have tools accessible from a tool strip.
7. Put in a Text/Font editor for the user so they can edit the size of the listPacketList text being presented.
